      <h4>How to spectate a match on Dominion Online <www.dominion.games></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Friend one of the players in the match on the client <www.dominion.games>. (Friend List > Add) </li>
        <li> Go back to Matching, find their name under Friends on the right and click the join button to spectate their game.
          <ul>
            <li>If they don't appear, repeat steps 1. and 2. with the other player or a known spectator as the player may have Followers off.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Check that the players' ability to see spectator chat is off before you type any game sensitive information. If the chat box (where you type) says:
          <ul>
            <li> <b>message spectators:</b> players cannot see spectator chat.</li>
            <li> <b>message:</b> players will be able to see the chat. </li>
        </li>
      </ol>

<!--
  Listening in VC (Voice Channel)
  Occasionally, players or commentators will stream the match in a Discord voice channel (found on the left of the server). They'll talk about the game state and strategy so you can listen while spectating in-client.
  1. Make sure you mute your mic so you do not distract them.
  2. Do not listen in if you are their opponent unless the tournament rules specifically allow it.
  3. If you are bothered by join/leave noises, you can turn it off in your User Settings (:gear:) > Notifications > Sounds.
