### Getting Started

* Read through all the information posted at the top of your division channel. It provides details on your opponents, your moderator, and deadlines for the season, as well as handy links to resources you'll need.
* Fill in the check-in form (pinned in your division channel) to confirm that you'll be playing and provide an overview of your availability.
* Use your division channel to start contacting your opponents to arrange your matches. Tag the whole division so that all your opponents will get a notification. Example post:

* Don't forget to check for and respond to posts from your opponents too.
* If you're unsure about anything or have a question, contact your moderator.

### Scheduling Matches

* Be proactive about scheduling! Asking if someone is online to play spontaneously does not often work well, so you should regularly post your upcoming availability in your division channel (make sure to tag the division or specific players). If you decline an opponent's suggestion for a time to play, offer another in response.
* Once you've arranged a time with an opponent, add your match to the matches calendar using the Calendar form pinned in your division channel. This helps your moderator to keep track of scheduling progress and additionally allows for spectators; they might be willing to share their discussions from the game chat afterwards to help you learn and improve.
* For answers to questions about scheduling, see [Section 3 of the FAQ](https://dominionleague.org/faq#3-scheduling-matches).

### Playing Matches

* Create a new table on dominion.games, or find your opponent's table by adding them to your friend list and then clicking Join next to their name on the Automatch tab. It is also possible to search through the list of tables, but remember that usernames are case-sensitive.
* Check that the table settings are correct (see [Section 4.5 of the rules](https://dominionleague.org/rules#4.5)). Generally, as long as you created a new table rather than re-using an existing one, this just means you need to:
   * Turn off "Players can see spectator chat".
   * Check that the Card Pool Level is set to 10 and that there are two landscape slots.
   * If neither player has a subscription, turn off the "Disliked" and "Banned" lists. Otherwise, leave these turned on.
* If you and your opponent both want to, you can change certain other table settings (see [Section 4.7 of the rules](https://dominionleague.org/rules#4.7)).
* Each match consists of six games.
* After the first game, turn off "Random player order" and set the player order manually each game so that you alternate who goes first.
* Immediately after you've finished a playing session, report the results using the Results form (pinned in your division channel). Only one player should report the results; typically the winner does this, unless you agree otherwise. Report the games you've just played even if the match is not complete. Later, when youâ€™ve played the remaining games, only report the new games; the system will add everything together.
* For answers to questions about playing matches, see [Section 4 of the FAQ](https://dominionleague.org/faq#4-playing-matches).

### Using DomBot

* You can message @DomBot on Discord to see information about your division and games you've played.
* The bot responds to messages that start with an exclamation mark (`!`), in your division channel or in a DM.
* For example, `!standings` shows the current standings for your division, and `!match <player1>, <player2>` shows recent games between two players. This can be useful if, for example, you don't remember the match score or which player went first.
* DomBot will also respond automatically to results submissions to confirm that the games on record match up with the report.
* Message `!help` to @DomBot for a full list of commands and help with using them!

### Need Help?

* If you need a moderator's attention urgently, use one of these contact methods:
   * Tag `@League Mod` in your division channel. Please tag the role for urgent matters; do not wait for your division moderator.
   * Send a message to the [Dominion League Hotline](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2NR9VkDRAU-lTTKJdyQOiUuFyCjMbh9Xf7HoANX-jakAFRw/viewform).
* If you have a non-urgent question or problem, you can:
   * Check the [Rules](https://dominionleague.org/rules) and/or [FAQ](https://dominionleague.org/faq) to see if they help with answering your question.
   * Tag your division moderator in your division channel.
   * Send your division moderator a DM.
   * Post a question in the #ask-the-league-mods channel.
