#### Errata

These errata are not included in the rulebooks linked above, but are official rules and are used in Dominion Online.

##### Updated cards

The abilities of these cards have changed since the rulebooks were last printed. Cards with the same abilities but new wordings (such as due to the "Gaining non-Supply cards" rule below) are not listed here.

* **Band of Misfits**: Action - Command, $5 *(Dominion: Dark Ages)*<br>Play a non-Command Action card from the Supply that costs less than this, leaving it there.
* **Captain**: Action - Duration - Command, $6 *(promo card)*<br>Now and at the start of your next turn: Play a non-Duration non-Command Action card from the Supply costing up to $4, leaving it there.
* **Death Cart**: Action - Looter, $4 *(Dominion: Dark Ages)*<br>You may trash this or an Action card from your hand, for **+$5**.<hr style="max-width: 200px; margin-left: 0;">When you gain this, gain 2 Ruins.
* **Embargo**: Action, $2 *(Dominion: Seaside)*<br>**+$2**<br>Trash this. If you did, add an Embargo token to a Supply pile. (For the rest of the game, when a player buys a card from that pile, they gain a Curse.)
* **Inheritance**: Event, $7 *(Dominion: Adventures)*<br>Once per game: Set aside a non-Command Action card from the Supply costing up to $4. Move your Estate token to it. (During your turns, Estates are also Actions with "Play the card with your Estate token, leaving it there.")
* **Lantern**: Artifact *(Dominion: Renaissance)*<br>Border Guards you play reveal 3 cards and discard 2. (It takes all 3 being Actions to take the Horn.)
* **Overlord**: Action - Command, 8D *(Dominion: Empires)*<br>Play a non-Command Action card from the Supply costing up to $5, leaving it there.
* **Pillage**: Action - Attack, $5 *(Dominion: Dark Ages)*<br>Trash this. If you did, gain 2 Spoils, and each other player with 5 or more cards in hand reveals their hand and discards a card that you choose.
* **Procession**: Action, $4 *(Dominion: Dark Ages)*<br>You may play a non-Duration Action card from your hand twice. Trash it. Gain an Action card costing exactly $1 more than it.
* **Village Green**: Action - Duration - Reaction, $4 *(Dominion: Menagerie)*<br>Either now or at the start of your next turn, **+1 Card** and **+2 Actions**.<hr style="max-width: 200px; margin-left: 0;">When you discard this other than during Clean-up, you may reveal it to play it.

##### Tracking rules

Some cards, like the new Band of Misfits, can play a card that isn't put into play. When you play Band of Misfits, leave it in play as long as you would have left the card it plays in play. Normally that will be the same turn's Clean-up. For a Band of Misfits playing a Duration card, it will be the Clean-up of the last turn the Duration card has any effects. For a Band of Misfits playing a Throne Room playing a Duration card, it will be the Clean-up of the turn the Duration card leaves play. For a Band of Misfits playing a card that can move itself from play, like Mining Village, the Mining Village can't move itself, so Band of Misfits doesn't leave play any earlier than normal. If a Band of Misfits plays multiple Duration cards (e.g., you used Throne Room on it), leave it out until the Clean-up of the last turn that one of them still had effects.

These rules apply to all of the cards that play cards without putting them into play: Band of Misfits, Captain, Inheritance, Necromancer, Overlord, and Way of the Mouse.

##### Stop-Moving rule

*Note: This replaces the Lose-Track rule, and is largely the same as it.*

An effect can move a card if it specifies where the card is coming from, or if the effect put the card where it is now. If a card isn't where the effect would expect it to be, or has moved away from there and then back, it can't move the card. Played cards expect to be in play; they can't move themselves if they aren't. Gained cards are expected to be where they were gained to, even if this isn't the discard pile. Cards in discard piles can be moved even if covered up by other cards; cards on top of a deck can't be moved once covered up.

Additionally, when you are told to get a card from your discard pile and that card is not the top card of your discard pile, you can look through your discard pile to get the card. You don't have to just look at the top couple of cards, you can look through the whole discard pile.

##### Gaining non-Supply cards

When a card tells you to gain a non-Supply card by name, you can gain it from its pile, even though it's not in the Supply (e.g. "Gain a Spoils.").

##### Reducing costs

The cost in Coins of a card can't go below 0 Coins. The cost in Potion of a card can't go below 0 Potion; the cost in Debt of a card can't go below 0 Debt.

#### Dominion Online bugs

Below is a list of cards and situations where the game rules aren't followed. This list does not include confusing or incorrect interface issues, or problems with the Lord Rattington AI.

* **Basilica, Colonnade, Defiled Shrine**: When buying a card triggers a Landmark, you cannot choose to resolve other "when you buy" abilities before the Landmark.
* **Blessed Village**: When you gain a Blessed Village during another player's turn, take The Field's Gift, The Forest's Gift, or The River's Gift, and choose to receive it now, the Boon is discarded during your next Clean-up phase instead of the very next Clean-up phase.
* **Capitalism + Black Market/Storyteller**: When you play Black Market or Storyteller during your Buy phase, you are not able to remove Coffers tokens from your mat.
* **Capitalism + Herbalist**: When you discard Herbalist from play, it can put itself onto your deck.
* **Crown + Scepter**: The game will freeze if you Crown a Scepter and choose to replay that Crown.
* **Fleet**: Fleet turns in multiplayer games can happen in the wrong order.
* **Fleet + Star Chart**: When you shuffle your deck during your Clean-up phase, if the next turn is a Fleet turn, you don't get to use Star Chart.
* **Governor**: When you play a Governor and choose the third option, you are forced to trash a card.
* **Hamlet**: If you have cards in hand when you play Hamlet, but have no cards in hand when you're asked to discard for +1 Buy, you can get +1 Buy without discarding anything.
* **The Horn**: The client chooses for you which Border Guard to put onto your deck. For example, it might choose a Border Guard you set aside with Prince.
* **Inn**: When you gain an Inn from the trash, you can only choose differently named cards to shuffle into your deck.
* **Inn + Possession**: When you gain an Inn while controlling another player with Possession, you cannot shuffle in any cards.
* **Magic Lamp**: When you play a Magic Lamp twice (such as via Crown), if you have at least 6 differently named cards with exactly 1 copy in play when you play it the second time, the game freezes.
* **Mint**: When you buy a Mint with Haggler in play or with another player's Swamp Hag affecting you, the game freezes.
* **Prince + Scheme**: If you put Princed card onto your deck, at the start of your next turn, it will be played from your hand.
* **Prince + Traveller**: If you exchange the Princed card, at the start of each of your turns, it will be played from its pile.
* **Royal Carriage**: Sometimes you can call Royal Carriage to replay a card that is no longer in play.
* **Scheme**: The client allows you to choose cards that are not being discarded from play, so those ones will fail to move onto your deck.
* **Small Castle**: When you play Small Castle and have no other Castles in hand, you are forced to trash the Small Castle from play.
* **Stonemason**: You cannot choose to overpay an amount that would not gain you cards.
* **Urchin + Adventures tokens**: You cannot choose to resolve Urchin's "when you play another Attack card" ability before any vanilla bonus tokens on the other Attack card's pile.
* **Villa**: You do not return to your Action phase until any other "when you gain" abilities due to gaining Villa are all resolved.
* **Way of the Squirrel**: The current player gets +2 Cards, even if that was not the player who played an Action using Way of the Squirrel.
* **Zombie Spy**: If you play Herald to reveal and play Necromancer, and then have no cards in your deck or discard pile, the game will freeze if you play Zombie Spy via the Necromancer.
