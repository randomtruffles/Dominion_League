    <h4> History of the Dominion League</h4>
    The Dominion League is the oldest Dominion online tournament out there.
    <br>
    <br>
    It was founded by <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/player_database.html?player=Stef">Stef</a> in April 2014 and hasn't stopped since. It originally originated as a <a href="http://forum.dominionstrategy.com/index.php?topic=10331.0">forum post</a> on the Dominion Strategy Forum, with opponents scheduling through forum messages. Most organization now takes place on the <a href="https://discord.gg/vMmmMBu">Dominion Discord</a>.
    <br>
    Stef, founder of the league, also served as the head League Moderator for 13 seasons, before <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/player_database.html?player=assemble%20me">assemble me</a> took over for the next 13 seasons. Then in 2018, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/player_database.html?player=SamE">SamE</a> took the torch as head League Moderator for the next 17 seasons, followed in 2021 by <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/player_database.html?player=alibby1152">alibby1152</a> for 14 seasons. As of 2023, the torch is now held by <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/player_database.html?player=tracer">tracer</a>, who will continue this longstanding tournament.
