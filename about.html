    <h4> History of the Dominion League</h4>
    The Dominion League is the oldest Dominion online tournament out there.
    <br>
    <br>
    It was founded by <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/player_database.html?player=Stef">Stef</a> in April 2014 and hasn't stopped since. It originally originated as a <a href="http://forum.dominionstrategy.com/index.php?topic=10331.0">forum post</a> on the Dominion Strategy Forum, with opponents scheduling through forum messages. Most organization now takes place on the <a href="https://discord.gg/vMmmMBu">Dominion Discord</a>.
    <br>
    Stef, founder of the league, also served as the head League Moderator for 13 seasons, before <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/player_database.html?player=assemble%20me">assemble me</a> took over for the next 13 seasons. Then in 2018, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/player_database.html?player=SamE">SamE</a> took the torch as head League Moderator for the next 17 seasons, followed in 2021 by <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/player_database.html?player=alibby1152">alibby1152</a> for 14 seasons. As of 2023, the torch is now held by <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/player_database.html?player=tracer">tracer</a>, who will continue this longstanding tournament.

    Each season of League lasts 6 weeks, and you are welcome to join us for every season or take a break for one or more seasons whenever you like.
    Everyone is welcome, regardless of skill or experience with the game; this is a friendly tournament and players are placed with others at a similar skill level.
    We also try to match players with others in the same or adjacent time zones (or with similar availability) to help ease scheduling of matches.
    The League is a great venue if you enjoy competitive play, or if you just want to dive deeper into Dominion and develop your own play! 
    Participation is completely free, but you will be expected to play with all cards from all expansions.
    We do recommend purchasing a subscription on dominion.games so that you can practice and play with more cards, but this is not required.
