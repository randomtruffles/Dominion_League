    <h4> History of the Dominion League</h4>
    The Dominion League is the most long-living Dominion online tournament out there.
    <br>
    <br>
    It was founded by <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/player_database.html?player=Stef">Stef</a> in April 2014 and hasn't stopped since. It originally originated as a <a href="http://forum.dominionstrategy.com/index.php?topic=10331.0">forum post</a> on the Dominion Strategy Forum, with opponents scheduling through forum messages. Most organization now takes place on the <a href="https://discord.gg/666Upcq">Dominion Discord</a>.
    <br>
    Since 2018, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/player_database.html?player=SamE">SamE</a> has taken on the role of head League Moderator and helped continue this longstanding tournament.
