Hello everyone,

Thank you to everyone who attended our two town halls during the long break for the Championship, and to everyone who provided feedback on the Returning Form. All your suggestions and input have lead to several rules changes. You can see the exact rules changes and rewordings in our [Rules Changelog](https://dominionleague.org/rules-changelog), but I’ll also summarize them here.

* Snake seeding was replaced with random seeding, as presented at the second Town Hall.
* 5th place will never demote from a 7-player flex division.
* As an experiment in the practice tier, players will use the expansion restriction that we polled in the Returning Form.
* We will use the systematic algorithm presented at the second Town Hall to give consideration to match results that were previously voided when one of the players drops.

We also have several other, more minor changes to make:

* Moderators will be allowed to take single-season breaks while maintaining their status as a moderator.
* The selection process for new moderators will be longer, so that more people may apply, and more consideration may be given to the applicants.
* The congratulatory messages (the ones with the clapping emoji in the #results channel) will now be sent in a dedicated #congratulations channel, as well as in the division channels.
* We will have a dedicated "stenographer" at future town halls (as we did for the most recent one) to make sure that they are accessible to text-only participants.
