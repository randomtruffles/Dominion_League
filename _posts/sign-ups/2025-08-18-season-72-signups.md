**Season 72** will run from Monday, October 13, until Sunday, November 23, and you can sign up until **Sunday, October 5 at 23:59 UTC** by filling out the [Google form](#sign-up-using-this-google-form) below.

You will need the following in order to sign up:

1. A [Dominion Online](https://dominion.games) account with 10 or more rated 2-player games.
   - These rated games need to be played by Sunday, October 5 at 23:59 UTC. If you do not reach 10 rated games by the deadline, your sign up will be removed.
2. An account on the [Dominion Discord](https://discord.gg/vMmmMBu).
   - All League communications will take place by default over Discord.
3. *(Optional)* An email address.
   - This gives the moderators a second means of contacting you for onboarding if we are unable to reach you on Discord. *The Dominion League is committed to keeping your email address confidential. We do not sell or provide your personal information to any third party.*

After you fill out the form, you should receive an automated notification on the Dominion Discord server within a few hours, indicating that we've got your sign-up. If you don't receive this, please check the [table of sign-ups](#sign-ups-and-counts) to make sure your sign-up went through and your details look correct. If any of the entries are highlighted in red, this indicates that we have detected a problem with that entry. If something is wrong, please fill in the form again with the correct details or reach out to the moderators, either on Discord or by using the [Dominion League Hotline](http://dominionleague.org/hotline).

A moderator will contact you on Discord to confirm your participation. You must reply to this message within 4-7 days depending on how close your sign-up is to the deadline. In addition, we require all players to **check in** during the first week of the season or forfeit their place. This consists of filling out a very short form to confirm that you plan to play the season that will be sent at the start of the season. If you fail to check in promptly, you could be removed.

#### Sign up using this Google Form:

**NOTE:** Season 71 players should **not** use this signup form and should instead fill out the Returning Form which is posted in their division channel on Discord.
