Season 43 has now started! If you're playing in the season, say hello and make sure to check in, where now also you'll be asked to give a description of when you'll be available to play your matches.

While the exact number of players will continue to fluctuate with late signups over the next week, we can also look at the number of divisions for a good sense of the size of the League. Here's what our pandemic-fueled growth has looked like:

* Season 39: 51 divisions (then a record)
* Season 40: 131 divisions
* Season 41: 142 divisions
* Season 42: 130 divisions
* Season 43: 126 divisions

So the decline we saw from Season 41 to 42 has continued, but has slowed. Some of the underlying metrics are actually looking up again. For instance, 74% of Season 42 players chose to come back for Season 43, up from 70% of Season 41 players (albeit out of a smaller total). The last time we had a big growth spurt, in Season 27, it took us four seasons to even crack 70%, and nine to reach 74%. New player recruitment had similarly leveled off, so we will probably remain right around this size for the rest of the pandemic.

The good news is that this means we're bringing new players into the culture of the League and they're choosing to stick around. We totally understand that there will be people whose interest fades after the pandemic no longer restricts their choices for leisure activities, but we hope that we've been enough of a welcoming community and life-giving hobby that you choose to stay regardless.

With the vaccine rollout on the horizon, many are turning their eyes to the future. Season 44 Signups open in a week, and we've got some changes in store:

1. We are removing the practice tier in Season 44. All players will be placed into the standard A-J tiers.
2. However, **all new players will now need to play a minimum of 10 rated games before joining**. This should ensure a minimum level of commitment to and familiarity with the game, as well as providing us with some calibration of your ability.
3. As [previously announced](https://dominionleague.org/2020/11/26/season-43-newsletter-part-1.html), players who sign up for the League next season can now offer their e-mail address as a backup means of communication. We will only e-mail you, from [the League mod e-mail account](mailto:dominionleaguemoderator@gmail.com), if you do not respond to messages on Discord.

In part due to the holidays and the lack of urgent topics, we will not be holding a town hall this season. Feel free to continue to give us actionable feedback in the Returning Form!
