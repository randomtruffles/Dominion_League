Welcome back to the Dominion League for season 66 after our long break. I hope that those of you who played in the Dominion Online Championship enjoyed that experience.

**New Player Guide**

This season we are introducing a guide to getting started in the Dominion League, which you can access at [dominionleague.org/player-guide](https://dominionleague.org/player-guide]). While this is primarily aimed at new league players, I encourage returning players to look over it as well - this is what many people in your division will be expecting. A link to this guide will replace some of the division channel opening posts next season.

I would like to give a special thanks to saltroza for driving this initiative to make players' introduction to the league smoother.

**Time Zoning Changes**

With lower numbers of divisions in each tier, we have moved to only having two zones that we place players into to make scheduling a bit easier: American and European. This mostly marks a change for American players; your divisions will now comprise players across the entire continent - please be conscious of this when scheduling and be sure to specify time zone when giving your availability.

There is also a higher chance for both zones of having players from Asian or Pacific time zones in your divisions. Be sure to check if your division has any, which may require scheduling at different times than you are used to playing.

**End of Summer Time**

This season will see the end of Summer Time in Europe (October 27) and Daylight Savings Time in North America (November 3). For those of you who schedule in UTC your offset will change. Be sure when scheduling around those weekends to be careful that you are scheduling for the time you intend to. Putting your match on the Match Calendar can be a great way to check - the confirmation in your division channel will contain a timestamp that should display your local time.

I hope everybody has a wonderful fall season, and as always, best of luck!
