Feature matches are back! These are exciting matches that the moderator team has identified as important to standings or otherwise worth drawing attention to. We will be featuring the match between [Naesala](https://dominionleague.org/player_database?player=Naesala) and [skumpy](https://dominionleague.org/player_database?player=skumpy) for division [C3](https://dominionleague.org/current_standings?div=c3). The match will be taking place on Sunday, November 6 at 17 UTC.

Naesala needs 4 wins to have a chance at promotion. skumpy needs at least 1.5 wins to make promotion a possibility. If Naesala wins 4.5 or more games, [seanahan](https://dominionleague.org/player_database?player=seanahan) loses promotion potential.
