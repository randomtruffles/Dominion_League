### Changed: Superpromotions ([5.4](/rules#5.4))

Old:
> <a name="5.3.5"></a>5.3.5. If you promote, you rise a minimum of one tier.

> 5.3.6. If you finish in first place (including ties) in tier F or below, you are evaluated by the new player rules in [2.4.3](#2.4.3). If these rules would place you in a higher tier than the standard promotion rules (see above), you are placed into the higher tier instead. If this rule would place you into D tier or higher, you are placed into E tier instead. This is referred to as a “superpromotion”.

New:
> <a name="5.3.5"></a>5.3.5. If you promote, you rise one tier.

> 5.4. Superpromotions
>
> Superpromotions allow you to promote multiple tiers at once, based on how you would be placed as new player.
>
> 5.4.1. If you played in tier G or below and finished in first place (including ties), you are eligible for a superpromotion.
>
> 5.4.2. If you are eligible, and would be placed higher by the new player placement rules ([2.4.3](rules/#2.4.3)) than by the standard promotion rules ([5.3](rules/#5.3)), you superpromote into the higher tier.
>
> 5.4.3. You cannot superpromote past E tier. If the new player placement rules ([2.4.3](rules/#2.4.3)) would place you in D tier or higher, you superpromote into E tier instead.
