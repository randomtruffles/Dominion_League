### Changed: Hiatus ([1.4](/rules#1.4))

> You retain your tier placement, space permitting (see [2.4](#2.4) and [2.5](#2.5)), during a short break of up to 2 consecutive seasons*, and after a medium break of 3-5 consecutive seasons.* If you rejoin after a long~~er~~ break of ~~3~~ *6* or more consecutive seasons, you will be placed as a new player.

### Changed: Tier Placement ([2.4](/rules#2.4))

> Players are placed into tiers using the following criteria, in order:
>
> 2.4.1. Players who played in the previous season are placed into their tier from that season, unless they earned a promotion or demotion ([5.3](#5.3)), in which case they are placed according to the promotion and demotion rules.
>
> 2.4.2. Players returning to the League after a short *or medium* break *of up to 5 consecutive seasons* ([1.4](#1.4)) are placed into the tier they would have most recently returned to, starting with the players that played most recently, and with ties broken by seeding ([2.6](#2.6)). *This can only trigger the creation of a flex division ([2.5](#2.5)) for players returning for a short break.*
>
> 2.4.3. Players returning to the League after a longer break *of 6 or more consecutive seasons* ([1.4](#1.4)), and players joining the League for the first time, are placed into tiers based on their Dominion Online level. Levels will be collected at a time specified on the [sign-up page](/sign-ups). *This can only trigger the creation of a flex division ([2.5](#2.5)) for players exceeding the strict level cutoff for a given tier.*
>
> 2.4.4. If there are still open spots in a tier, players in the tier below may receive free promotions to fill them. See [5.5](#5.5) for details.

### Changed: Flex Divisions ([2.5](/rules#2.5))

> Divisions usually have a maximum of 6 players. However, divisions may "flex" up to a size of 7 players in order to accommodate ~~returning~~ players *returning from a short break ([1.4](#1.4),* [2.4.2](#2.4.2)) or particularly highly-rated players ([2.4.3](#2.4.3)). Free promotions ([5.5](#5.5)) are only used to fill divisions up to the normal maximum of 6 players.
