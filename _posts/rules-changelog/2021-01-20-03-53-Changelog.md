### Practice tier

The Practice tier was not renewed for Season 45.

Removed (Section I. League Structure):

> In Seasons 42 and 43, there shall also be a practice tier, separate from all other tiers, for players who have played less than 30 rated 2-player games online. Players in the practice tier will be similarly grouped and seeded.

Removed (Section II. Match Structure and Policies):

> For Seasons 42 and 43, games in the practice tier must be rated.

> For Seasons 42 and 43, in the Practice Tier, the players pick one expansion each, and Kingdoms are generated with only cards from those expansions and the base set.

> Players in the practice tier may not play games in-person or on any platform other than Dominion Online.

> Players in the practice tier may not agree for games to be unrated.

Removed (Section III. Standings):

> Players in the practice tier do not promote or demote automatically. Instead, these players are placed as new players in the next season.

Removed (Section IV. Joining and Leaving):

> For Seasons 42 and 43, players who join and have not played in one of the past 6 seasons and have played 29 or fewer rated 2-player games shall be placed into the practice tier.


### Undo rules

Clarified that "small number" refers to the quantity of steps, not the quantity of undos.

Old (Section II. Match Structure and Policies):

> The League’s default is to grant undos of small numbers of non-information-revealing steps

New:

> The League’s default is to at least grant all undos that are for small numbers of steps that did not reveal new game information.


### Adjustment matches

Corrected the rules to match the system that was approved and implemented.

Old (Section IX. Dropping Players Mid-Season)

> The following rules are used for dropped players:
> * If the removed player played no games, they are removed and the remaining players play one fewer match. If possible, the moderators will replace them with a player from the waiting list
> * If the removed player played any games, their match results are instead simulated by averaging the average winning percentage of the dropped player and the average losing percentage of their opponent in all games they did play, and then scaling these results by the percentage of their games they actually played. Additionally, if scaling these simulations to 0% and 100% would yield different promoters or demoters, an adjustment match is needed to better decide the standings between the affected players. In an adjustment match, the players play a 2-game match with each player starting one of the games. If the players are tied after those 2 games, they play one final game with a random player starting. If there is still a tie, the player that went second in the last game wins.

New:

>The following rules are used for dropped players:
> * If the removed player played no games, they are removed and the remaining players play one fewer match. If possible, the moderators will replace them with a player from the waiting list
> * If the removed player played any games, their remaining match results are instead simulated by averaging the average winning percentage of the dropped player and the average losing percentage of their opponent in all games they did play, and then scaling these results by the percentage of their games they actually played.
>
> At the end of the season, to account for the approximations inherent in simulated results, adjustment matches may be required to better decide the standings between players straddling a promotion or demotion boundary. To determine if an adjustment match is needed, 4 scenarios are compared:
> * Scale the simulated results by the percentage of the games the first player actually played against all dropped players.
> * Round all unscaled results to the nearest 0.5, then scale the simulated results by the percentage of the games the first player actually played against all dropped players.
> * Scale the simulated results by the percentage of the games the second player actually played against all dropped players.
> * Round all unscaled results to the nearest 0.5, then scale the simulated results by the percentage of the games the second player actually played against all dropped players.
>
> If the 4 scenarios do not all yield the same promoter or demoter, an adjustment match is needed. In an adjustment match, the players play a 2-game match with each player starting one of the games. If the players are tied after those 2 games, they play one final game with a random player starting. If there is still a tie, the player that went second in the last game wins. The winner is placed ahead of the loser in the final standings.
