### Changed: Table settings reference ([4.6.6](/rules#4.6.6))

> Under "Kingdom Options", no particular cards, landscapes, landscape types, or expansions should be selected or excluded. Colonies and Shelters should be set to random. This will result in a randomly-generated kingdom using all cards that either player has access to, with zero to two landscapes and a maximum of one Way. Note that Allies *and Prophecies* are not considered landscapes, so this can result in kingdoms with up to two landscapes*,* plus an Ally if a Liaison is present *and/or a Prophecy if an Omen is present*. Note that the two landscape slots ~~may~~ *might* not be included by default if your automatch card pool level is set below 10 (see [4.5.3](#4.5.3)).
