### New section: Membership requirements ([1.1.6](/rules#1.1.6))

> <a name="1.1.6"></a>1.1.6. You are able to commit both the necessary time to play your matches, and the necessary time to coordinate with your opponents via Discord to schedule your matches. Note that while playing your matches will require approximately two hours per week during the season, you will usually need more available time than this, in order to accommodate your opponents' schedules.

### Changed: Matches ([4.1](/rules#4.1))

> A match is 6 games between the same two players~~, with each player going first 3 times~~. Each player plays one match against each other player in their division.
>
> ...
>
> <a name="4.1.2"></a>~~4.1.2. The first game should have a random starting player, and then starting player should alternate for the remaining games.~~

### New section: Playing sessions ([4.2.3](/rules#4.2.3))

> <a name="4.2.3"></a>4.2.3. You may only change your banned, disliked, and liked cardlists between playing sessions.

### New section: Starting player ([4.4](/rules#4.4))
> Each player should go first 3 times in a 6 game match. It is each player's responsibility to ensure that they get 3 starts in a match.
>
> <a name="4.4.1"></a>4.4.1. The first game of a match should have a random starting player. This is the default setting when creating a new table on Dominion Online.
>
> <a name="4.4.2"></a>4.4.2. Starting player should alternate for the remaining games.
>
> <a name="4.4.3"></a>4.4.3. If the table host makes a mistake in setting starting player, future games should be used to correct the discrepancy as quickly as possible. For example, if player A starts games 1 and 2, player B should start games 3 and 4. This should be done even if it is not possible for one of the players to receive 3 starts. For example, if player A starts games 1 through 4, player B should start games 5 and 6.
>
> <a name="4.4.4"></a>4.4.4. If the table host makes a mistake in setting starting player, and this mistake is caught during an ongoing game that has not reached turn 2, either player may request that the game be abandoned only if one player cannot reach 3 starts using future games per [4.4.3](#4.4.3). Otherwise, the game must be played out normally.
>
> <a name="4.4.5"></a>4.4.5. Games cannot be voided after the fact due to a mismatch in starting player counts.

### New section: Timers ([4.10](/rules#4.10))
> Games in the Dominion League do not user a timer.
>
> <a name="4.10.1"></a>4.10.1. The "Make (opponent) Resign?" prompt in Dominion Online should only be used to address connection issues and other technical difficulties (see [4.11](#4.11)). It should not be used to enforce speed of play on your opponent.

This must be done before the start of turn 2. In this case, you or your opponent should extend your subscription before starting a new game. You may not otherwise agree to abandon a game based on the contents of the kingdom.*

### Changed: Playing under protest ([4.14](/rules#4.14))

Old:
> In the case of a disputed rules infraction, you should reach out to a moderator for help. If a moderator decision needs to be made that affects the outcome of a game, you should finish the game, and you may protest the game by contacting your moderator with a description of what occurred and the game number. The moderator team will review the game and make a ruling by a majority vote whether the game results stand or that the game must be replayed.

New:
> In the case of a disputed rules infraction during a Dominion League game, you should initiate the following procedure:
>
> <a name="4.14.1"></a>4.14.1. Inform your opponent that you believe an infraction occurred, and that you're playing under protest.

>

>
> <a name="4.14.4"></a>4.14.4. The moderators will review the dispute and issue a ruling based on a majority vote. This may result in the disputed game being voided and replayed.

### Changed: Extra/non-standard matches ([4.15](/rules#4.15))

> <a name="4.15.1"></a>4.15.1. Adjustment and tiebreaker matches are 2 game matches with each player starting one of the games. *You and your opponent may play a 4 or 6 game match instead by mutual agreement.*
>
> <a name="4.15.2"></a>4.15.2. Play-in matches are ~~standard~~ 6 game matches.~~, but if one player reaches 3.5 or more wins, they win the match, and there is no need to complete any remaining games.~~
>
> <a name="4.15.3"></a>*4.15.3. If one player reaches 2.5 or more wins in a 4 game match, or 3.5 or more wins in a 6 game match, they win the match, and there is no need to complete any remaining games.*

### Changed: Tiebreakers ([5.2](/rules#5.2))

> If there is a tie within a division, ~~these steps are applied with the group of tied players:~~ *a head-to-head tiebreaker is applied. If there is still a tie, a tiebreaker match may be required.*
>
> #### <a name="5.2.1"></a>5.2.1. Head-to-head *tiebreaker*
> ...
>
> <a name="5.2.2.1"></a>5.2.2.1. If ~~a~~ *an unbroken* two-way tie affects promotions, demotions, or entry into the Championship Match, the players play a tiebreaker match. The format for this match is specified in [4.15](#4.15).
>
> <a name="5.2.2.2"></a>5.2.2.2. If ~~a~~ *an unbroken* three (or more) way tie affects promotions, demotions, or entry into the Championship Match, the moderators will randomly break the tie.

### Changed: Superpromotions ([5.4.2](/rules#5.4.2))

> <a name="5.4.2"></a>5.4.2. If you are eligible, and would be placed higher by the new player placement rules ([2.4.3](#2.4.3)) than by the standard promotion rules ([5.3](#5.3)), you superpromote into the higher tier. *Note that, in practice, superpromoting players use a different, stricter set of Dominion Online level cutoffs than new players.*

### Changed: Dropped players ([5.6](/rules#5.6))

Old:

> The following rules are used to account for dropped players in the standings. See [7.1](#7.1) for more information about drops.
>
> <a name="5.6.1"></a>5.6.1. If the dropped player played no games, they are removed and the remaining players play one fewer match. If possible, the moderators will replace them with a player from the waiting list.
>
> <a name="5.6.2"></a>5.6.2. If the dropped player played any games, their remaining match results are instead simulated by averaging the average winning percentage of the dropped player and the average losing percentage of their opponent in all games they did play. Afterward, all the match results involving the dropped player are scaled by the percentage of their games they actually played.
>
> <a name="5.6.3"></a>5.6.3. At the end of the season, to account for the approximations inherent in simulated results, adjustment matches may be required to better decide the standings between players straddling a promotion or demotion boundary. To determine if an adjustment match is needed, 4 scenarios are compared:
>
> <a name="5.6.3.1"></a>5.6.3.1. Scale all the dropped player’s match results by the percentage of the games the first player actually played against all dropped players.
>
> <a name="5.6.3.2"></a>5.6.3.2. Round all unscaled results to the nearest 0.5, then scale all the dropped player’s match results by the percentage of the games the first player actually played against all dropped players.
>
> <a name="5.6.3.3"></a>5.6.3.3. Scale all the dropped player’s match results by the percentage of the games the second player actually played against all dropped players.
>
> <a name="5.6.3.4"></a>5.6.3.4. Round all unscaled results to the nearest 0.5, then scale all the dropped player’s match results by the percentage of the games the second player actually played against all dropped players.
>
> <a name="5.6.4"></a>5.6.4. If the 4 scenarios do not all yield the same promoter or demoter, an adjustment match is needed. The format of this match is specified in [4.15](#4.15). The winner is placed ahead of the loser in the final standings.
>
> <a name="5.6.5"></a>5.6.5. Dropped players finish last place in their division and will demote, which may affect their placement in subsequent seasons they return to.

New:

> The following rules are used to account for dropped players in the standings. See [7.1](#7.1) for more information about drops.
>
> <a name="5.6.1"></a>5.6.1. Dropped players finish last place in their division and will demote, which may affect their placement in subsequent seasons they return to.
>
> <a name="5.6.2"></a>5.6.2. If the dropped player played no games, they are removed and the remaining players play one fewer match. If possible, the moderators will replace them with a player from the waiting list.
>
> #### <a name="5.6.3"></a>5.6.3. Adjustment match determination
> 
> If a dropped player played any games, adjustment matches may be needed to determine promotions or demotions. The format of adjustment matches is specified in [4.15](#4.15). The following procedure determines whether an adjustment match is required:
>
> <a name="5.6.3.1"></a>5.6.3.1. Order all remaining players by win percentage in games that were played and note who promotes and who demotes.
>
> <a name="5.6.3.2"></a>5.6.3.2. Order all remaining players by win percentage in games not involving the dropped players and note who promotes and who demotes.
>
> <a name="5.6.3.3"></a>5.6.3.3. If the promoters (or demoters) are not the same in both scenarios, then the players who promote (or demote) in one scenario, but not the other, play an adjustment match.
>
> <a name="5.6.3.4"></a>5.6.3.4. If the players in contention played the same number of games against each dropped player, only the all games played scenario ([5.6.3.1](#5.6.3.1)) is considered.
>
> <a name="5.6.3.5"></a>5.6.3.5. If there is an unbroken tie (see [5.2](#5.2)) for promotion or non-demotion in at least one of the scenarios, the tied players play an adjustment match. They do not play a tiebreaker match.
>
> <a name="5.6.3.6"></a>5.6.3.6. If a player promotes in one scenario and demotes in the other, then that player doesn't play in any adjustment matches and doesn't promote or demote.
>
> <a name="5.6.3.7"></a>5.6.3.7. If more than two players have promotion or non-demotion claims, the moderators will determine what adjustment matches are needed, if any, at their discretion.

### Removed sections: Moderator division quotas & Moderator breaks

> ### <a name="8.5"></a>~~8.5. Moderator division quotas~~
>
> ~~Each active moderator will moderate at least 5 divisions per season.~~
>
> ### <a name="8.6"></a>~~8.6. Moderator breaks~~
>
> ~~Moderators are eligible for 1-season breaks, during which they retain voting privileges and access to moderator Discord channels.~~
>
> <a name="8.6.1"></a>~~8.6.1. If more moderators want to take breaks than the team can afford, moderators who have gone the longest without a break will receive priority.~~

### Changed: Passing amendments ([9.1.1](/rules#9.1.1))

> <a name="9.1.1"></a>9.1.1. Moderators may vote “no opinion”, in which case their vote doesn't count towards establishing or preventing a majority. *This also applies to other moderator votes, including rulings on protested games ([4.14](#4.14)).*
