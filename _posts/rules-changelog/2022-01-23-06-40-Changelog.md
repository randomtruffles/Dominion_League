### New section: Membership requirements ([1.1.6](/rules#1.1.6))

<a name="1.1.6"></a>1.1.6. You are able to commit both the necessary time to play your matches, and the necessary time to coordinate with your opponents via Discord to schedule your matches. Note that while playing your matches will require approximately two hours per week during the season, you will usually need more available time than this, in order to accommodate your opponents' schedules.
