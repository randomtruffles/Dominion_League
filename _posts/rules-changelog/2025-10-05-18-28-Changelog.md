### Changed: Tiers ([2.3](/rules#2.3))

> 2.3.3. Tiers F through ~~K~~ *J* have a minimum of 6 divisions each. If there are not enough players to meet this requirement, tiers will be eliminated as necessary.

### Added: Tiers ([2.3.4](/rules#2.3.4))

> 2.3.4. Tier K has a minimum of 6 divisions. If Tier K falls below 6 divisions for two consecutive seasons, it will be eliminated after the second such season.

### Added: Play speed ([3.5](/rules#3.5))

> Players are allowed to play at a relaxed pace, but are nonetheless expected to meet a minimum threshold of play speed, out of consideration for their opponents.
> 
> 3.5.1. Play speed within a match is evaluated via adjusted excess time. Your adjusted excess time is calculated by averaging the number of decisions that you and your opponent made during a match, multiplying the result by your average time per decision, doing the same for your opponent, then subtracting your opponent's value from your value. For example, if you took 4 seconds per decision over 450 decisions, and your opponent took 3 seconds per decision over 550 decisions, the average decision count would be `(450+550)/2 = 500`, your adjusted time would be `4s*500 = 2000s`, your opponent's adjusted time would be `3s*500 = 1500s`, and your adjusted excess time would be `2000s-1500s = 500s = 8.33m`.
>
> 3.5.2. When calculating adjusted excess time, if your opponent's average time per decision is less than 3.5 seconds, a value of 3.5 seconds is used instead. This value was determined by rounding up the league median decision time over a sample of several seasons to the nearest 0.5 seconds. It is meant to avoid flagging players as especially slow merely due to having especially fast opponents.
>
> 3.5.3. Players are expected to keep their adjusted excess time under 45 minutes. Based on data the League has collected over several seasons, this is a very generous threshold that only the very slowest players are at risk of crossing.

> 3.5.4.
