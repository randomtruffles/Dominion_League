### Changed: Tier placement ([2.4.3](/rules#2.4.3))

> 2.4.3. Players returning to the League after a medium break ([1.4.2](/rules#1.4.2)) are placed into the tier they would have most recently returned to, or the tier they would be placed into as a new player ([2.4.4](/rules#2.4.4)), whichever is higher, starting with the players who played most recently, and with ties broken by seeding ([2.6](/rules#2.6)). If there is insufficient space in a *given* tier to accommodate players returning from a medium break, they will be placed in the *highest possible* tier below *the given tier that can accommodate them without needing a flex division to do so*.

### Added: Modifying table settings ([4.7.1](/rules#4.7.1))

> 4.7.1. You may enable the option to increase the frequency of recent card releases (e.g. "Extra 2nd Edition" or "Extra Plunder").
