## Rules rewrite

The league rules have been completely rewritten to be easier to read and reference. The content is unchanged, but the rules now use a completely different structure/layout, and there have been wording changes as well, which are intended to increase clarity.

You can now refer to individually numbered rules sections in the format:\
https://dominionleague.org/rules#(number), e.g. <https://dominionleague.org/rules#4.9>

For reference, you can find the old rules [here](https://dominionleague.org/oldrules).
