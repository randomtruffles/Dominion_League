### Changed: Table settings ([4.5](/rules#4.5))

Old:
> 4.5.4. If your automatch card pool level is lower than 10, your table settings may have fewer than two landscape slots by default. If this happens, manually add landscape slots until you have two.

New:
> 4.5.3. "Card Pool Level" should be set to 10, and there should be two landscape slots. Although this is usually the table default, changing your automatch card pool settings can change these settings when you create a table.

### Removed: Table settings reference ([4.6](/rules#4.6))

> 4.6.6. "Card Pool Level" should be set to the highest possible value. This will be 10 if at least one player has a Complete subscription. Otherwise, it will be 5 if at least one player has a Core subscription. If neither player has a subscription, it will be 1.
