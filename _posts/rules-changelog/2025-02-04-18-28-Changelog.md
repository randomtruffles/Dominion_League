### Changed: Tier Placement ([2.4](/rules#2.4))

Old:
> 2.4.4. Players returning to the League after a long break ([1.4.3](#1.4.3)), and players joining the League for the first time, are placed into tiers based on their Dominion Online level. Levels will be collected at a time specified on the [sign-up page](/sign-ups). If there is insufficient space in a tier to accommodate players exceeding the strict level cutoff, one or more flex divisions ([2.5](#2.5)) will be created.

New:
> 2.4.4. Players returning to the League after a long break ([1.4.3](#1.4.3)) are placed the same way as players returning to the League after a medium break (see [2.4.3](#2.4.3)), except that the tier they would have returned to decays downward based on the length of their break. Up to a cap of three, for each six full seasons of break, the tier they would have returned to decays by one. Thus, for players returning from 6-11 season breaks, the tier they would have returned to decays by one. Likewise, for 12-17 season breaks, there is a two tier decay, and for 18+ season breaks, there is a three tier decay.

If there is insufficient space in a tier to accommodate players exceeding the strict level cutoff, one or more flex divisions ([2.5](#2.5)) will be created.

### Changed: Extra/non-standard matches ([4.16.1](/rules#4.16.1))

> 4.16.1. Adjustment and tiebreaker matches are 2-game matches with each player starting one of the games. You and your opponent may play a 4- or 6-game match instead by mutual agreement *if you are not participating in a three (or more) player, round-robin tiebreaker*.

### Changed: Promotion or demotion implications ([5.2.2.2](/rules#5.2.2.2))

> 5.2.2.2. If an unbroken three (or more) way tie affects promotions, demotions, or entry into the Championship Match, *the moderators will offer each player involved the opportunity to play in a round-robin tiebreaker, using the format specified in [4.16](/rules#4.16). If any of the players involved declines to participate*, the moderators will randomly break the tie.
