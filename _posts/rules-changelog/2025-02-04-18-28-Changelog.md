### Changed: Tier Placement ([2.4](/rules#2.4))

Old:
> 2.4.3. Players returning to the League after a medium break ([1.4.2](#1.4.2)) are placed into the tier they would have most recently returned to, or the tier they would be placed into as a new player ([2.4.4](#2.4.4)), whichever is higher. Slots are filled starting with A tier and working downward. If there is insufficient space in a given tier to accommodate players returning from a medium break, they will be placed in the highest possible tier below that tier that can accommodate them without needing a flex division to do so, starting with the players who played most recently, and with ties broken by seeding ([2.6](/rules#2.6)).
> 
> 2.4.4. Players returning to the League after a long break ([1.4.3](/rules#1.4.3)), and players joining the League for the first time, are placed into tiers based on their Dominion Online level. Levels will be collected at a time specified on the [sign-up page](/sign-ups). If there is insufficient space in a tier to accommodate players exceeding the strict level cutoff, one or more flex divisions ([2.5](/rules#2.5)) will be created.

>
> 2.4.4. Players returning to the League after a long break ([1.4.2](/rules#1.4.2)) are placed according to their decay-adjusted returning tier ([2.4.5.2](/rules#2.4.4.2)) or their level-based placement ([2.4.5.1](/rules#2.4.4.1)), whichever is higher.
>
> 2.4.4.1. A player's level-based placement is the same as their placement would be if they were joining the League for the first time (see [2.4.4](/rules#2.4.4)).
> 
> 2.4.4.2. A player's decay-adjusted returning tier is the tier they would have most recently returned to (adjusted according to any intervening structural transition schemes), reduced by 1 tier for each 6 full seasons their break lasted, up to a maximum reduction of 3 tiers. For example, the decay-adjusted returning tier of a player who would have returned to B and then took a 6-11 season break would be C. A player's adjusted returning tier cannot be below the league's lowest tier (see [2.3](/rules#2.3)).
>
> 2.4.4.3. When placing players according to their retained placement, slots are filled starting with A tier and working downward. If there is insufficient space in a given tier to accommodate such players, they will be placed in the highest possible tier below that tier that can accommodate them without needing a flex division to do so, starting with the players who played most recently, and with ties broken by seeding ([2.6](/rules#2.6)).

### Changed: Extra/non-standard matches ([4.16.1](/rules#4.16.1))

> 4.16.1. Adjustment and tiebreaker matches are 2-game matches with each player starting one of the games. You and your opponent may play a 4- or 6-game match instead by mutual agreement *if you are not participating in a three (or more) player, round-robin tiebreaker*.

### Changed: Promotion or demotion implications ([5.2.2.2](/rules#5.2.2.2))

> 5.2.2.2. If an unbroken three (or more) way tie affects promotions, demotions, or entry into the Championship Match, *the moderators will offer each player involved the opportunity to play in a round-robin tiebreaker, using the format specified in [4.16](/rules#4.16). If any of the players involved declines to participate*, the moderators will randomly break the tie.
