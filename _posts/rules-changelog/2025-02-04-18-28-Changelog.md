### Changed: Extra/non-standard matches ([4.16.1](/rules#4.16.1))

> 4.16.1. Adjustment and tiebreaker matches are 2-game matches with each player starting one of the games. You and your opponent may play a 4- or 6-game match instead by mutual agreement *if you are not participating in a three (or more) player, round-robin tiebreaker*.

### Changed: Promotion or demotion implications ([5.2.2.2](/rules#5.2.2.2))

> 5.2.2.2. If an unbroken three (or more) way tie affects promotions, demotions, or entry into the Championship Match, *the moderators will offer each player involved the opportunity to play in a round-robin tiebreaker, using the format specified in [4.16](/rules#4.16). If any of the players involved declines to participate*, the moderators will randomly break the tie.
