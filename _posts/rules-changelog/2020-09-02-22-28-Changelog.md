A few updates as a result of the Season 41 Rules Meeting.

## **VI. Playing Competitively**

Clarifying difference between resigning vs. forfeiting.

Added (Section X, League Moderation):

> To clarify the meaning of forfeit, there is a difference between resigning while playing to the best of your ability (like when you are way behind and feel there is a 0% or a very low chance to comeback), and forfeiting (which is like resigning turn 1, 2 or not playing at all).
