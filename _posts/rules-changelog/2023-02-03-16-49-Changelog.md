### Changed: Starting player ([4.4.4](/rules#4.4.4))

> If the table host makes a mistake in setting starting player, and this mistake is caught during an ongoing game that has not reached turn 2, *and if one player cannot reach 3 starts using future games per [4.4.3](#4.4.3),* either player may request that the game be abandoned ~~only if one player cannot reach 3 starts using future games per [4.4.3](#4.4.3)~~. Otherwise, the game must be played out normally.

### Changed: Table settings ([4.5.3](/rules#4.5.3))

> For games without expansions, or with a Card Pool Level of 1, the "Disliked" and "Banned" options for "Respected Cards" should be off.

### Changed: Table settings reference ([4.6.6](/rules#4.6.6))

> "Card Pool Level" should be set to ~~10~~ *the highest possible value. This will be 10 if at least one player has a Complete subscription. Otherwise, it will be 5 if at least one player has a Core subscription. If neither player has a subscription, it will be 1*.

### Added: Other tournaments ([5.8](/rules#5.8))

> Games played for other tournaments may not be counted as Dominion League games.

### Changed: Deadlines ([6.2](/rules#6.2))

> In order to ensure that matches are completed in a timely fashion, players must meet a number of deadlines throughout the season. All deadlines are on Sundays at 23:59 UTC. We encourage players to stay well ahead of these deadlines - they are not the expected pace. ~~We also encourage players to add their scheduled matches~~ *For the purpose of meeting these benchmarks, all scheduled matches must be added* to the [League calendar form](/calendar/form), as this makes it easier for both the moderators and our automated systems to track scheduling progress.
