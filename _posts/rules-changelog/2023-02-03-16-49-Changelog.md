### Changed: Deadlines ([4.12](/rules#4.12))

> In order to ensure that matches are completed in a timely fashion, players must meet a number of deadlines throughout the season. All deadlines are on Sundays at 23:59 UTC. We encourage players to stay well ahead of these deadlines - they are not the expected pace. ~~We also encourage players to add their scheduled matches~~ *For the purpose of meeting these benchmarks, all scheduled matches must be added* to the [League calendar form](/calendar/form), as this makes it easier for both the moderators and our automated systems to track scheduling progress.
