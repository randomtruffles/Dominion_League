#﻿## Changed: Starting player ([4.4.4](/rules#4.4.4))

>﻿ <a name="4.4.4"></a>4.4.4. If the table host makes a mistake in setting starting player, and this mistake is caught during an ongoing game that has not reached turn 2, *and if one player cannot reach 3 starts using future games per [4.4.3](#4.4.3),* either player may request that the game be abandoned ~~only if one player cannot reach 3 starts using future games per [4.4.3](#4.4.3)~~. Otherwise, the game must be played out normally.

### Added: Other tournaments ([5.8](/rules#5.8))

> Games played for other tournaments may not be counted as Dominion League games.

### Changed: Deadlines ([6.2](/rules#6.2))

> In order to ensure that matches are completed in a timely fashion, players must meet a number of deadlines throughout the season. All deadlines are on Sundays at 23:59 UTC. We encourage players to stay well ahead of these deadlines - they are not the expected pace. ~~We also encourage players to add their scheduled matches~~ *For the purpose of meeting these benchmarks, all scheduled matches must be added* to the [League calendar form](/calendar/form), as this makes it easier for both the moderators and our automated systems to track scheduling progress.
