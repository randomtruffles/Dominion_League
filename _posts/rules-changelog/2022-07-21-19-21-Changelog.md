### Changed: Hiatus ([1.4](/rules#1.4))

> You retain your tier placement, space permitting (see [2.4](#2.4) and [2.5](#2.5)), during a _short_ break of up to ~~5~~ _2_ consecutive seasons. If you rejoin after a _longer_ break of ~~6~~ _3_ or more consecutive seasons, you will be placed as a new player.

### Changed: Tier Placement ([2.4.2](/rules#2.4.2))

> 2.4.2. Players returning to the League after completing ~~one of the past 6 seasons~~ _a short break (see [1.4](#1.4))_ are placed into the tier they would have most recently returned to, starting with the players that played most recently, and with ties broken by seeding ([2.6](#2.6)).

### Changed: Tier Placement ([2.4.3](/rules#2.4.3))

> 2.4.3. Players returning to the League ~~who did not complete one of the past 6 seasons~~ _a long break (see [1.4](#1.4))_, and players joining the League for the first time, are placed into tiers based on their Dominion Online level. Levels will be collected at a time specified on the [sign-up page](/sign-ups).

### Changed: Table settings reference ([4.6.3](/rules#4.6.3))

> 4.6.3. "~~Extra Allies~~*Extra 2nd Edition*" should be off.

### Removed: Suggested schedule (6.1)

> ~~The League recommends you play at least one match per week. In F tier and below, a suggested schedule is posted in your divisionâ€™s Discord channel and gives you an opponent to play each week. Although many players find this helpful, there is no requirement to follow this suggested schedule.~~

### Changed: Deadlines ([6.2](/rules#6.2))

> In order to ensure that matches are completed in a timely fashion, players must meet a number of deadlines throughout the season. All deadlines are on Sundays at 23:59 UTC. We encourage players to stay well ahead of these deadlines - they are not the expected pace. *We also encourage players to add their scheduled matches to the [League calendar form](/calendar/form), as this makes it easier for both the moderators and our automated systems to track scheduling progress.*
