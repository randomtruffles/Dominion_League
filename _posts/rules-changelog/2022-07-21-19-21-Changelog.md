### Changed: Hiatus ([1.4](/rules#1.4))

> You retain your tier placement, space permitting (see [2.4](#2.4) and [2.5](#2.5)), during a break of up to ~~5~~ *2* consecutive seasons. If you rejoin after a break of ~~6~~ *3* or more consecutive seasons, you will be placed as a new player.

### Changed: Table settings reference ([4.6.3](/rules#4.6.3))

> 4.6.3. "~~Extra Allies~~*Extra 2nd Edition*" should be off.

### Removed: Suggested schedule ([6.1](/rules#6.1))

> ~~The League recommends you play at least one match per week. In F tier and below, a suggested schedule is posted in your divisionâ€™s Discord channel and gives you an opponent to play each week. Although many players find this helpful, there is no requirement to follow this suggested schedule.~~
