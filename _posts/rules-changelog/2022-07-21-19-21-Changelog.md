### Changed: Hiatus ([1.4](/rules#1.4))

> You retain your tier placement, space permitting (see [2.4](#2.4) and [2.5](#2.5)), during a break of up to ~~5~~ *2* consecutive seasons. If you rejoin after a break of ~~6~~ *3* or more consecutive seasons, you will be placed as a new player.

### Changed: Table settings reference ([4.6.3](/rules#4.6.3))

> 4.6.3. "~~Extra Allies~~*Extra 2nd Edition*" should be off.

### Removed: Suggested schedule (6.1)

> ~~The League recommends you play at least one match per week. In F tier and below, a suggested schedule is posted in your divisionâ€™s Discord channel and gives you an opponent to play each week. Although many players find this helpful, there is no requirement to follow this suggested schedule.~~

### Changed: Deadlines ([6.2](/rules#6.2))

> In order to ensure that matches are completed in a timely fashion, players must meet a number of deadlines throughout the season. All deadlines are on Sundays at 23:59 UTC. We encourage players to stay well ahead of these deadlines - they are not the expected pace. *We also encourage players to add their scheduled matches to the [League calendar form](/calendar/form), as this makes it easier for both the moderators and our automated systems to track scheduling progress.*
