### Added: Championship match ([5.7.1](/rules#5.7.1))

> 5.7.1. The Championship Match uses the same rules as a standard League match ([4](#4)), except that starting player in the first game is whichever player is in first place. In the case of an unbroken tie, starting player in the first game is chosen randomly.
