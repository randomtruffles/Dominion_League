Each season, the Dominion League Moderators will be publishing select results from our feedback questions, both for accountability to them and to be able to reference them later should players have questions about why something is the way it is.

Starting this season we will be accepting feedback in our always-open [suggestion box form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSsEFkoOEZK3mQVjeq7hUmZBQVUG70oAMBmJs0VKh_dmN4dQ/viewform). We are hoping that this will bring more ideas our way with people not needing to remember them for the returning form.

### Season 49 Town Hall (Kingdom Selection Restrictions)

During the Season 49 Town Hall, there was a lively discussion about what all should be allowed with respect to deviating from table defaults for selecting kingdoms for league. There was discussion and polling on a number of changes players could mutually agree to: playing with fewer expansions, specifying the expansions of cards, selecting specific card-shaped things by name, rerolling boards, and use of public and private 3rd-party generators.

The polling showed few people actively looking for making changes, and depending on the deviation a varied number of people either okay or not okay with others making the change. Given the lack of support for banning some deviations, we as moderators decided that some changes should still be allowed, and that given precedent, there should be a high bar for disallowing changes to kingdom generation that are currently allowed.

As such, we will be imposing the following restrictions: players may specify at most 1 card or landscape by name; players may not agree to reroll boards that they have already seen for reason of not wanting to play the board; and players may not agree to use private 3rd-party kingdom generators (if you have questions about something being allowed here, ask a moderator).

### Returning Form Questions

On the season 50 returning form, we asked questions about sorting players into divisions by time zone and the length of tiebreakers.

#### Time Zone Based Divisions

#### Tiebreaker Length

### Looking Forward to Season 50

Most of the freeform feedback we received from players this past season fit into categories of either play speed or the league calendar. In addition to a scheduled question about the lengths of seasons, you can look for some questions about timing on next season's returning form.

The Season 50 Town Hall will be on the topic of the league calendar, including placement of breaks during the year and when there should be extra weeks off.
