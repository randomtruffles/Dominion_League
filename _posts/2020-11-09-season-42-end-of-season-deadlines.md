Season 42 officially ends on Sunday, November 22. To account for the westernmost timezones, **the deadline for reporting matches is Monday, November 23, at 15:00 UTC.**
If you need extra time to finish, **you must contact your group moderator** to request an extension of up to one week. **All late finish matches must be reported by Monday, November 30, at 15:00 UTC.**

If you fail to request an extension or complete the match by the late deadline, the responsible player(s) will be considered to have dropped mid-season. This means that they are banned for the next two seasons, and automatically demoted when they return. If they played any games, those are kept for the other players' standings, however, the weight of matches played against that player are adjusted based on the percentage of games that they played. Their remaining matches are "simulated" (see [the full rules](https://dominionleague.org/rules.html) for how.)

In addition to finishing your matches, all players must fill out the returning form to tell us whether they will be back for next season. **The deadline for filling out the returning form is Monday, November 30, at 15:00 UTC** (the Season 43 signup deadline). Any players who have not told us whether they will be back by then will be assumed to be not returning.
