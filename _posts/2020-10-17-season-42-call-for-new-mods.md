The Dominion League is run by a team of volunteer moderators, and with shifting responsibilities we are looking for more. If interested, please fill out the form at <https://forms.gle/86odM6kNu8juseiA9>.

Applicants should be able to respond to Discord notifications within 24 hours and have played at least 2 full recent seasons in the League. We are accepting applications until October 25th at 0 UTC and will aim to add the successful applicants to the moderator team the following weekend.

As a moderator, you should plan to be able to:
- Moderate 7–8 divisions during the season: respond to any questions from the players in them, message players who fall behind, and then remove them if there is no response or they are unable to finish the season.
- Participate in a few training meetings during the month of November, usually lasting 30–60 minutes.
- Meet with fellow moderators on the final weekend of each season to discuss and vote on any necessary rules changes (though missing on occasion is okay). For Season 42, this will be the weekend of November 21st or 22nd. These meetings typically start during the European evening and vary in length, but usually last an hour or two.
- Meet with fellow moderators on the weekend before each season to set everything up (though missing on occasion is okay). For Season 43, this will be the weekend of December 5th or 6th. These meetings also typically start during the European evening and vary in length but usually last a few hours, including post-meeting tasks.
- Complete miscellaneous tasks including onboarding new players and making Google Sheets adjustments.

All applications will be considered at once, so if you need some time to consider feel free to take it.
