Welcome to season 67 of the Dominion League.

**Moderator Turnover**

After nearly four and a half years, Rozyroz has left the moderator team. As Onboarding and then Outreach chair, Rozyroz played a major role in making the new player experience what it is today. We thank her for her service to the community in these roles and others.

On a brighter note, this season will mark the return of Naesala to the moderator team. In addition to some onboarding and division moderation responsibilities, Naesala will be running our featured matches this season, a huge task for which we are happy to have additional help.

**Feedback Summary**

On the season 67 returning form, we asked players about use of cardlists in league matches. While most players who responded wished to keep the status quo, the comments showed some confusion about the meaning of lists and what the status quo is. An explainer on cardlists can be found on the [Dominion Online Forum here](https://forum.shuffleit.nl/index.php?topic=3552.0) and our current policy of defaulting to using ban and dislike lists in games with expansions can be found in [sections 4.5 through 4.7 of the rules here](https://dominionleague.org/rules#4.5).

We received many comments about difficulty scheduling this past season, so will be returning to the topic of scheduling during a Town Hall this season. Keep an eye on the #announcements channel for information regarding timing and content.

**Holiday Season**

The midwinter holidays are coming up midway through this season. Acknowledging that this is often a difficult time to schedule, we will not be enforcing the scheduling benchmarks on week 3 (weekend of December 28th and 29th). However, you will still be expected to meet the week 4 scheduling benchmarks afterwards, so if you are out during this period you will need to be flexible about scheduling directly after. Better yet, get ahead of schedule before the holidays and you will not need to worry about being behind after.

I wish you all a happy holiday season and best of luck in the coming League season as well!
