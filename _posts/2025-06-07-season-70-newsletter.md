Welcome to season 70 of the Dominion League!

**Moderator Turnover**

As we move into season 70, we say goodbye to 4 longtime moderators: amoffett11, Gazbag, nottoobad, and snowbz. Combined they served as moderators for over 20 years and impacted hundreds of players with their division moderation, assistance with onboarding, and behind the scenes work. The Dominion League could not be what it is today without the work of all of its moderators, and they were no exception.

We also say hello to a new moderator, GaryOfPgh2, who brings to the team 40 seasons of experience as a player. Some of you may have already met Gary during your onboarding, and I hope many more of you get to in your divisions over the coming seasons.

**Feedback Summary**

Our season 69 townhall was an AMA for the moderators - it was a lot of fun for us to answer your questions and I hope you had just as much fun asking them. We intend to continue holding these every 1-2 years when there is not a pressing topic.

On the season 70 returning form we asked about preferences regarding division size, and while the overwhelming majority of responses asked to keep the status quo, there was a theme in the comments of being concerned about the amount of movement between tiers. We will be holding a short townhall this season about player churn and numbers of promoters and demoters in our 6 player divisions - be on the lookout for more information about it.

As always, best of luck and best of fun this coming season, and for those of you in the northern hemisphere enjoy the summer season!
