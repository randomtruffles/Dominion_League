Welcome to season 70 of the Dominion League!

**Moderator Turnover**

As we move into season 70, we say goodbye to 4 longtime moderators: amoffett11, Gazbag, nottoobad, and snowbz. Combined they had served as moderators for over 20 years and no doubt had impacted hundreds of players with their division moderation, assistance with onboarding, and behind the scenes work.
