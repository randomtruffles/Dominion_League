## Week 1: D4, chesstick vs duhmark<br><sup>[Video with commentary by Mort and saltroza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEdNHwkMhs)</sup>
This was an engaging match with several kingdoms that provided a good degree of ambiguity as to the optimal strategy. chesstick took the first game in convincing style, with the slightly weak draw being greatly ameliorated by judicious Delivery (largely of Ferryman and his Vassal). 

The second game offered a strong engine with plenty of villages, draw and buys but slightly weak payload, with duhmark snatching up Plunders and both players taking advantage of Commerce to add Golds. chesstick had the better-controlled deck and seemed to be in command of the game, but overreached towards the end and left a win open — which duhmark unfortunately missed on their turn, allowing chesstick to finish off the Provinces. 

Game three also went chesstick's way, with a 7–3 split on Hasty Hunters leaving duhmark with inadequate draw and perhaps a few too many Villas in deck.

Undeterred, duhmark rallied to take the fourth game, with some neat Governor-based play around chesstick's Frigates and a points lead (attained largely via Aqueduct) that proved decisive.

Game five was a close one: it began with a particularly cute opening involving Hasty Farmhands played with Way of The Butterfly to gain Replace. chesstick ultimately built the stronger draw deck, taking the lion's share of the Witch's Huts; duhmark's potential for slightly greater control over the piles looked for a moment as though it might prevail nevertheless, but they didn't quite have the draw to support the gains, and chesstick found just enough to pile out on turn 11. 

Finally, game six offered the messiest kingdom and the most tense endgame. After opening with Potion and Battle Plan, duhmark was able to play several Familiars before chesstick (who opened with Sculptor on 5/2) could even get one into his deck — a very significant advantage with non-Treasure trashing being limited to Farmland and Necromancer. Before long, chesstick had 9 of the Curses and the game looked over, but the specific path towards victory was not at all clear (although ample fun with rotation of the Castles pile was had by duhmark along the way). By seizing his chances to take Territories and Castles, chesstick was able to draw out the game to a very close finish, just one coin short of a win on turn 29 and with both decks rammed with junk of various kinds. It wasn't quite enough, and duhmark took the victory on the following turn, for a final match score of 4–2 in chesstick's favour. 

## Week 2: E3, tufftaeh vs Viking39<br><sup>[Video with commentary by saltroza and Bienchen1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1MAYPaUV3M)</sup>

This week's match was good battle with some closely fought games! We started out with a 5/2 opening for both players on a Vampire board, the Vampires ramping up draw quickly via Werewolf with Villas added as needed. Viking39 opted to take Herbalist rather than nothing in the opening and was also impeded by some early bad draw luck and a War hex that only helped his opponent; soon he was struggling for deck control while tufftaeh had emptied the Villas and lowered two other piles. A well-placed Delusion bought Viking39 one more turn, but it wasn't enough and tufftaeh was able to pile out once free of the hex. 

In game two, Viking39 took the advantage on Friendly Saunas and Avantos and also managed to gain a Voyage while denying this to tufftaeh; however, tufftaeh's deck was once again under better control a bit sooner, and he was able to apply greater pile pressure via a small crew of Quartermasters, finishing off the game with some high-scoring Vineyards.

The third game offered an exciting Populate to build towards. The draw was a bit tricky (the options being Hireling, Advisor and Pooka) and the decks were junky at first, with plenty of Cursed Golds being played. Viking39 was the first to hit Populate but made a tactical error with the ordering, gaining Inn first, which meant he couldn't take advantage of its on-gain ability to shuffle the other gains into his deck. Meanwhile, tufftaeh was building towards some explosive payload with a bevy of Priests; he came close to managing a winning triple Province turn, but was a little short on draw and opted to trash one of his Priests, which prevented the win. Viking39 was able to close it out using Golds gained via Hoard as his main souce of payload. 

Game four presented a strong but very tricky board, with no +Buy but powerful gaining via Fortress, Altar, Advance and Engineer. tufftaeh seemed to have the upper hand at first but then took more Duchies than his deck could really handle, relinquishing deck control for a sloggy but interesting endgame. Seizing his chance, Viking39 played a promising-looking turn but then triggered a junk-filled shuffle, leading to a dud. Even this extra turn granted to tufftaeh wasn't quite enough, however, and Viking39 was able to take the pile-out to draw the match level.

Game five offered Armory/Cemetery for trashing, but both players struggled to line up good trashes early on, leading to decks that never quite got under control. tufftaeh filled up on Highways; he was a little short on Buys to support them, but did eventually create an opportunity to take a Cavalry autopile and finish off the Menageries for the win. He missed this and scored with Province instead, but did manage to find an ending on the next turn. 

Finally, game six provided an interesting board with Advisor draw and a Menagerie Mouse. A moderately late but effective Mint was taken on both sides and Gold-minting commenced as fodder for Enlarge. Fleet added some interest, making the endgame Province-milling less clearly winning than usual for tufftaeh, but he was able to execute the manoeuvre successfully, leaving Viking39 unable to catch up on his Fleet turn and finishing out the match with a 4–2 win overall.

## Week 3: F3, miked1991 vs ceneij<br><sup>[Video with commentary by JNails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAHh5-AVrc)</sup>

This was an interesting and closely fought match showcasing a good variety of the brand new Rising Sun cards! In game one we saw the prophecy Kind Emperor, as well as a neat demonstration of the new debt rules, which were relevant both for the new card Change and for Black Market purchases. The game started out a little slowly, with ceneij (perhaps mistakenly) playing a Search with Daimyo, which left the Daimyo temporarily suspended in set-aside land. From around this point, miked1991 seemed ahead, but eventually he lowered the piles slightly too much while not quite scoring enough to prevent ceneij from ending the game on a win. 

In the second game, the spectators speculated that Flourishing Trade might hold promise of plentiful Peddlers, with Actions from Rustic Village being the only source of +Buy available. The players chose a different route, with miked1991 in particular being taken to task by commentator JNails for loading up on treasures, including Platinum, without the +Buy to make use of them. Some Rustic Villages were eventually acquired, but it was a little too late for real deck control and the Trade never did Flourish; miked1991 eventually prevailed through single-Colony turns.

Game three presented an initial kingdom with Kitsune cursing, plenty of trashing, various forms of draw, and Pouch as the only +Buy; but after a few turns (during which some Madmen were obtained and a Ronin was notably grabbed by miked1991), the piles were whisked away by a Divine Wind, which brought in Butcher, Enlarge, and some more sources of +Buy. The decks were fairly junky from the Kitsune curses, and deck control was never really attained; some Golds from Courtier were Enlarged to Province to good effect by miked1991, and he was able to double-Province on turn 16, which effectively closed out the game. 

We next saw a remarkably aggressive kingdom featuring Approaching Army and no fewer than eight Attack cards! With no village either, this made for a sloggy game without too much to do but load up on Relics and attack opportunistically with the more terminal options. ceneij had a couple of opportunities to take what might have been an effective Alliance but chose to buy Province instead; miked1991 eventually stacked up enough points that ceneij was left with no way to catch up.

We moved on to a perhaps more interesting fifth game: Kitsune made another appearance, this time paired with Great Leader, and the board offered plentiful engine components, including Marquis, Daimyo and Encampment. Both players opted for Silver/Rats openings, with an eye for Transmogrify/Rats shenanigans, but perhaps loaded up a little too aggressively on the Rats without quite enough Transmogrification to keep them in check. Eventually, ceneij was quicker getting the Rats under control, with some help from Great Leader, who boosted the value of Marquis significantly. Meanwhile, miked1991 found an opportunity to take double Province that might have put him in a winning position, but he lowered the piles further alongside a single Province instead, leaving ceneij able to finish it off with a winning pile-out on Rats, Marquis and Curse. 

Finally, we saw a game in which both players made interesting use of Transmute, ceneij taking the lead on this by opening with Potion and Silver while miked1991 took Tea House on the 5/2. miked1991 was able to get his deck under control to a greater extent with the help of Rice Broker and some Root Cellars for extra draw, eventually taking the win for a 4–2 match win overall as well.
