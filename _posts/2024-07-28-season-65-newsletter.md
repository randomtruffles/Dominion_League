Welcome to season 65 of the Dominion League. This season has some unusual aspects, so please read on.

**Moderator Turnover**

I am pleased to welcome bobbydj18 to the moderator team. bobbydj18 has been playing in the league since season 30 so has plenty of experience around the league environment. Some of you may have already met him during your onboarding and the rest of you will possibly see him moderatoing one of your divisions soon enough.

As a reminder, moderator applications are now always open, and you can apply [here](https://dominionleague.org/moderators/apply).

**Extended Break Coming**

Please note that after this season, it will be 5 weeks until season 66 starts. This extended break is intended to give players the opportunity to play in the annual Dominion Online Championship, which there will be more information available about shortly. We will make an announcement when signups open.

**Rising Sun Release**

It is expected that a new expansion, called Rising Sun, will release online midway through this season. You can find more information about it and discussion on the [Rising Sun channel](https://discord.com/channels/212660788786102272/1234550320907030648) of the Dominion Discord. As a reminder, as per [Section 4.8 of the rules](https://dominionleague.org/rules#4.8) either player may request that Rising Sun cards not appear in your matches. That said, we strongly encourage players to try playing with the new cards - after all, there is only one way to learn them.

It is also possible that there will be previews available to play with during the week before the expansion releases. If both players agree, you may play with previews on. There may also be an option to play with "Extra Rising Sun" - again, if both players agree you may turn this option on for your league games.

As always, I hope you have fun this season, and best of luck both here and in the Dominion Online Championship should you choose to join it.
