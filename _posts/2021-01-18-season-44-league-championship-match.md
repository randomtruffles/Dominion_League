The Dominion League Season 43 Championship Match is set for this Sunday, January 24th at 20 UTC. The match features 2020 Shuffle iT Champion [nasmith99](https://dominionleague.org/player_database?player=nasmith99) and 17-time League Champion [Mic Qsenoch](http://dominionleague.org/player_database?player=Mic%20Qsenoch). Holding a one game lead heading into the match, nasmith needs 3 wins to secure his first title, whereas Mic needs 3.5 to overcome the deficit and win by virtue of his 6.5-5.5 combined record between the regular season and Championship matches.
