Welcome to Season 73 of the Dominion League.

**Moderator Turnover**

Coming into season 73 we say good bye to two longtime moderators: bobbydj18, who had moderated for a year and a half, and singletee, who had moderated for nearly seven years. Their contributions both in internal discussions and in the many divisions they have moderated over the years will be missed.

As a result, we are looking to add moderators for season 74 to help us moderate divisions. If you think you might be interested, please apply at [https://dominionleague.org/moderators/apply](https://dominionleague.org/moderators/apply).

**Increased Benchmark Messaging**

As a moderator team we feel that players have too often been running into the benchmark weeks without warning. The benchmarks are intended to be the bare minimum pace to not be dropped from the league; our true expectation is that players schedule at a one match per week pace throughout the season.

This season we will begin pinging players the week they are at risk of needing to schedule multiple matches in any single week the remainder of the season. Additionally, the bot messages on the benchmark weeks will direct you to take action in the division channel - you will be required to follow these instructions to avoid being dropped.

**Holiday Season**

Midway through this season is the traditional midwinter holiday season. Please consider this during your scheduling: if you are planning to not play league during these weeks, make sure that you have met the benchmarks for those weeks *before* your midseason break. Similarly, do not count on completing all of your matches during this time, as some of your division-mates may be out during it.

Best of luck this Dominion League season and a happy holiday season for those that celebrate!
