Season 51 has kicked off and it's nice to see matches already being scheduled and played. Heading into the season, we bid farewell to one of our mods, sweetjohn33, who is stepping away after eight seasons. There will be a call later this season for those who would be interested in joining the moderator team. This is in line with our policy of doing so at least once every three seasons.

I would also like to call attention to the Season 51 Feedback Report that was published last week. This report summarizes the results of our Town Hall on the league calendar and other questions we solicited feedback on in the returning form. One change I would like to call attention to is the change in the league calendar. We will be taking a shorter break for the Dominion Online Championships, 4 weeks instead of 6, and spreading out the remaining two weeks throughout the year. To align the calendars, we will be taking a three week break after this season rather than the typical two.

Also recently announced in the Dominion Discord in our announcements channel was a summary of rules changes heading into this season. These revolve around changes to table settings in response to the recent Shuffle iT client update, rules to cover the release of new cards outside of expansions, and a focus on in-season deadlines (more to come later). You can find the full change log [here](https://dominionleague.org/rules-changelog).

And now, for some additional changes and updates.

**Tier Contraction**

As some of you have  noticed, especially in tiers F and below, the promotion scheme looks a little different than you've become accustomed to. The reason for this is that unless we see a surge in new signups for next season, we will be contracting down to 9 tiers, leaving only A-I in Season 52. Technically, this should have happened this season, but we were very close to the number of players needed (589) to maintain 10 tiers and didn't know until too late that we wouldn't reach that number. We began this season with 582 players and have a few more now on the waiting list. Rather than hurriedly and surprisingly spring the 9 tier system on everybody, we will instead make the switch following this season.

How does this impact us this season? As mentioned above, we will be using a revised transition scheme to bring us to our future 9 tier league. We developed this scheme assuming that we would have an equal number of players in Season 52 as we do now in Season 51. Assuming 588 players and 98 divisions, we would have 1 A division, 2 B divisions, 4 divisions in C and D, 8 E divisions, 16 divisions in F and G, 23 divisions in H, and 24 divisions in I. To make that happen from where we are now, we have the following:
