Welcome to season 69 of the Dominion League! There are no major announcements for this upcoming season but a couple of quick items:

**Feedback Summary**

On last season's returning form we asked about card pool use in league matches. An overwhelming number of players in all tiers preferred our status quo of using level 10 in all matches for which it is available. We will be making no changes here.

This season we will be holding an Ask Us (the moderators) Anything Townhall. Feel free to prepare and bring questions about anything: league history, rules, behind-the-scenes. Be on the lookout for further announcements regarding exact timing.

**Moderator Applications**

While moderator applications are always open, I wanted to provide a reminder that we are always looking for more people to help out. In particular, we are looking for new moderators willing to place an emphasis on community outreach. If you are interested in helping out, please apply at [dominionleague.org/moderators/apply](https://dominionleague.org/moderators/apply).

**Form Access**

There have been some changes in the way our forms' permission structures work, and we are still in the process of ironing out processes for handling these. If you are unable to access a form (Check-in, Results, Returning, Signup), please contact the moderator team immediately, either using [the hotline](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2NR9VkDRAU-lTTKJdyQOiUuFyCjMbh9Xf7HoANX-jakAFRw/viewform) or by typing `@League Mod` into Discord. **_You should never need to request personal access to anything for League_**, so please do not and let us know if something is asking you to do so.

As always, best of luck this upcoming season, and we hope to continue providing a positive experience in the seasons to come.
