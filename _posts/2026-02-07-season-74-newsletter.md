Welcome to season 74 of the Dominion League! A few updates:

**Moderator Addition**

We are happy to welcome swaggner to the moderator team this season! Some of you may have already met swaggner during onboarding and I hope the rest of you will get to meet him either as a division moderator or other roles in the seasons to come.

We also have GaryOfPgh2 taking our Community Outreach chair position, which had been vacant for some time. GaryOfPgh2 will continue to run our featured match program this season, and will also be creating some additional features about the league and moderators - stay on the lookout.

**Timer Release**

Dominion Online has been publicly beta testing their timer feature, and we expect it will release to the main site sometime during this season. We will hold a Town Hall on its use in the Dominion League during season 75, when people will have more familiarity with the settings. In the interim, we have set some rules surrounding timer usage:
- If you and your opponent mutually agree, you may use the Patient timer setting in your League matches
- Even if your opponent runs out of time on this setting, you are not allowed to force them to resign and count it as a loss for them

Note that these will not be the permanent league rules, but will be in place through the end of season 75 - the town hall during that season will inform our path for season 76 and the future.

**American DST upcoming**

During this season, North America will enter Daylight Saving Time on March 8th (Europe will enter their Summer time after the season is over). Please be aware if you are in a DST-using jurisdiction and are scheduling across time zones that your UTC offset will change on this date.

Best of luck this season and make sure to have fun!
