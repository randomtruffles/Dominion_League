We are excited to welcome two new moderators to our team for Season 43: Sharur and sweetjohn33. Sharur has played in the Dominion League since season 23, and had a run of 9 consecutive season in which he either promoted or demoted. Sweetjohn33 has played in the league since Season 38, which is approximately half the time of Sharur's streak.
