Welcome back all after our extended break. The final rounds of the Dominion Online championship are still wrapping up, so keep an eye on the #matches channel for some exciting Dominion to watch.

**Moderator Turnover**

This season we bid farewell to breppert and Naesala, who served on the moderator team for 8 and 17 seasons, respectively. In recent seasons, they have both managed our featured matches program in addition to the divisions you may have seen them in. They will be missed.

I am happy to announce the return of Rozyroz to the moderator team, who had previously served as a moderator for 26 seasons. She has already been bringing her valuable experience to the onboarding process and you may see her in your division this season.

**Play Speed Enforcement**

Based on feedback received during our town hall, we will be starting automatic tracking of play speed this season, the data from which will be used for moderator informed enforcement. As a moderator team, we believe this is a strong step towards reducing one of the reasons many players cite when leaving the league and a point of frustration we receive frequent feedback about from those who stay. 

For most players, the only change you will experience is a few additional lines in the !match outputs in your division channels detailing pace. **No players will receive a suspension this season**. That said, please review the official rules here and feel free to ask any questions that arise: [https://dominionleague.org/rules#3.5](https://dominionleague.org/rules#3.5)

**End of Summer Time**

During this season European Summer Time will end on October 26th and North American Daylight Savings Time a week later on November 2nd. Please keep this in mind when scheduling using UTC - your offset will be changing if you are in an affected time zone.

Best of luck this coming season!
