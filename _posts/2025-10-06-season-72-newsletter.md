Welcome back all after our extended break. The final rounds of the Dominion Online championship are still wrapping up, so keep an eye on the #matches channel for some exciting Dominion to watch.

**Moderator Turnover**

This season we bid farewell to breppert and Naesala, who served on the moderator team for 8 and 17 seasons, respectively. In recent seasons, they have both managed our featured matches program in addition to the divisions you may have seen them in. They will be missed.

I am happy to announce the return of Rozyroz to the moderator team, who had previously served as a moderator for 26 seasons. She has already been bringing her valuable experience to the onboarding process and you may see her in your division this season.

**Play Speed Enforcement**

Based on feedback received during our town hall, we will be starting automatic play speed enforcement this season. As a moderator team, we believe this is a strong step towards reducing one of the major reasons many players end up leaving the league and a point of frustration for many who stay.

For most players, the only change you will experience is an additional couple lines in the !match output for your division detailing pace, and no players will be suspended this season. That said, please review the official rules here and feel free to ask any questions that arise:
