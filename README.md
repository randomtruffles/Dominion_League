### How the repository is organized

#### Main Directory

- The main directory contains all the main pages found in the navigation bar (anything ending in `.html` or `.markdown` represents a page on the website)
  - `index.html` (Home page)
  - `sign-ups.html` (Sign-ups)
  - `matches.html` (Matches)
  - etc.
- Other files in the main directory are used to generate the site, and are not important (eg. `Gemfile`)

#### `/_posts` Subdirectory

- This contains all newsletters/sign-ups/update posts made by the league. All the files are written in `YYYY-MM-DD-<Title_of_article>.markdown`. Any markdown syntax (ie. bolding/headings) will be converted automatically to the same syntax in the physical site page.

#### `/img` Subdirectory

- This contains all images used on the site. The images are organized into its relevant category (eg. `/moderators` contains all pictures of the moderators)

#### `/_data` Subdirectory

- This contains all overall "information" and "settings" of the site (ie. the moderators, the template settings, etc.) to be used by pages and must be in `.yml` format.
  - `moderators.yml`
    - Contains a list of moderators and information regarding name, discord handle, etc. to be used. Eg.
    ```

      image: truffles
    ```
  - `nav.yml`

          path: rules.html
        - name: F.A.Q.
          path: faq.html
    - name: Matches
      ...
    ```

    - Contains the template settings to be used across the site, including font, colors etc.

#### `/_layouts` Subdirectory

- This contains all types of layouts you can use throughout the site. Eg. `default, newsletters, post...`. You can specify how a page looks by indicating `layout = default` at the top of each `.html` or `.markdown`.

### Development Setup Instructions
To run and test the site locally
1. Install Jekyll using the instructions [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
2. Install Ruby using the instructions [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
3. Install Bundler using the instructions [here](https://bundler.io/)
4. In your terminal in the project's folder, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
   - It will provide you with a port to launch your site locally

### Why use Jekyll?
- It is able to generate static pages, which increases the simplicity. For example, it is able to take markdown pages and generate complete pages.
  - This means that moderators with limited dev experience, can contribute to the site with only knowing markdown.
- Jekyll has built in design control, meaning that it is easy to make a few templates and use pre-created templates for multiple pages.
- Can be used with Github, which means that we don't need to pay for hosting (as you can host it on Github!)

### Editing the Website Layout
- All layout templates are found inside `_layouts.html`
- Each page in the site (eg. `index.html`) contains an information header at the top, which specifies what type of layout the page will use.
    ```
    ---
    layout: default_index
    ---
    ```
#### Editing Templates of Pages

1. Navigate to the `/_layouts.html` subdirectory and directly edit templates there.
2. Layout templates may 'include' certain shared elements (such as a navigation bar), which are found in the `/_includes` subdirectory.

##### Editing elements specific to pages**

1. Edit directly in the page (eg. `site.html`)

##### Editing overall design elements

- `style.css` is located in `/_includes/css/style.css`
- Overall font/colors is located in `/_data/template.yml`
