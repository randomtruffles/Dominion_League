# <a name="1"></a>1. Registration

## <a name="1.1"></a>1.1. Membership requirements

To join the Dominion League, you must meet all these requirements:

<a name="1.1.1"></a>1.1.1. You have a [Dominion Online](https://dominion.games/) account with 10 or more rated 2-player games. You do not need to purchase a subscription to Dominion Online.

<a name="1.1.2"></a>1.1.2. You are a member of the [Dominion (by Donald X Vaccarino)](https://discord.gg/vMmmMBu) Discord server.

<a name="1.1.3"></a>1.1.3. You are not already playing in the Dominion League with any other Dominion Online or Discord accounts.

<a name="1.1.4"></a>1.1.4. You have basic English language proficiency, so you can communicate with the moderators and your opponents.

<a name="1.1.5"></a>1.1.5. Your username and profile picture comply with the conduct rules in [3.3](#3.3).

## <a name="1.2"></a>1.2. Signing up

If you meet all the requirements and are not playing in the current season, you may fill out the [sign-up form](http://dominionleague.org/sign-ups) for the upcoming season. A moderator will review your submission and contact you via Discord. Until they do, your participation is not confirmed.

<a name="1.2.1"></a>1.2.1. After the sign-up deadline passes, you may still sign up for the waiting list. If spots open up during the early weeks of a season, moderators may fill them with players from the waiting list, depending on skill and time zone. Players who have dropped from the current season may not re-enter via the wait list.

## <a name="1.3"></a>1.3. Returning

If you are playing in the current season and would like to join the next season, fill out the Returning Form linked in your division’s Discord channel. Otherwise, you will by default leave the League after the current season.

## <a name="1.4"></a>1.4. Hiatus

You retain your tier placement, space permitting (see [2.4](#2.4) and [2.5](#2.5)), during a break of up to 5 consecutive seasons. If you rejoin after a break of 6 or more consecutive seasons, you will be placed as a new player.

## <a name="1.5"></a>1.5. Accounts

You may switch your Dominion Online or Discord account at any time by letting your moderator know, but you may not join the League additional times using other accounts.

## <a name="2"></a>2. League Structure

## <a name="2.1"></a>2.1. Pacing

Each season lasts 6 weeks, and most are followed by a 2-week break. Once per year there is a longer 6-week break for the Shuffle iT Championship tournament in September.

## <a name="2.2"></a>2.2. Divisions

A division is a group of approximately 6 players who will play each other during a season. Each division is assigned a moderator from the [League moderator team](https://dominionleague.org/moderators). The number of divisions depends on the number of players.

## <a name="2.2"></a>2.3. Tiers

The divisions are grouped into tiers. The number of tiers depends on the number of divisions. There is a single division in tier A. Starting with tier B, the following rules dictate the size of a tier:

<a name="2.3.1"></a>2.3.1. The maximum number of divisions in a tier is twice the maximum of the tier above it, except every third tier which has the same maximum number as the one above it.

<a name="2.3.2"></a>2.3.2. Tiers A through D always have the maximum number of divisions. The moderators at their discretion may choose to have fewer than the maximum number of divisions in tiers E and below.

<a name="2.3.3"></a>2.3.3. The lowest two tiers have approximately the same number of divisions.

<a name="2.3.4"></a>2.3.4. The moderators may make exceptions to these tier count rules to account for probable changes in the size of the League.

## <a name="2.4"></a>2.4. Tier Placement

Players are placed into tiers using the following criteria, in order:

<a name="2.4.1"></a>2.4.1. Players who played in the previous season are placed into their tier from that season, unless they earned a promotion or demotion ([5.3](#5.3)), in which case they are placed according to the promotion and demotion rules.

<a name="2.4.2"></a>2.4.2. Players returning to the League after completing one of the past 6 seasons are placed into the tier they would have most recently returned to, starting with the players that played most recently, and with ties broken by seeding ([2.6](#2.6)).

<a name="2.4.3"></a>2.4.3. Players returning to the League who did not complete one of the past 6 seasons, and players joining the League for the first time, are placed into tiers based on their Dominion Online level. Levels will be collected at a time specified on the [sign-up page](http://dominionleague.org/sign-ups).

<a name="2.4.4"></a>2.4.4. If there are still open spots in a tier, players in the tier below may receive free promotions to fill them. See [5.4](#5.4) for details.

## <a name="2.5"></a>2.5. Flex Divisions

Divisions usually have a maximum of 6 players. However, divisions may “flex” up to a size of 7 players in order to accommodate returning players ([2.4.2](#2.4.2)) or particularly highly-rated players ([2.4.3](#2.4.3)). Free promotions ([5.4](#5.4)) are only used to fill divisions up to the normal maximum of 6 players.

## <a name="2.6"></a>2.6. Seeding

Each tier of players is split into divisions by a seeding algorithm. The algorithm takes into account time zones in tiers E and below, previous performance in the League for returning players, and Dominion Online level for new players.

# <a name="3"></a>3. Conduct

## <a name="3.1"></a>3.1 Behavior

You are expected to treat all players with respect at all times. Examples of inappropriate actions include rage quitting, intentionally slow playing, and unexpectedly or suddenly changing the match arrangements per [4.5](#4.5).

## <a name="3.2"></a>3.2. Communication

Be kind and polite when communicating with players and moderators. Examples of inappropriate communications include swearing, harassment, and excessive complaints of luck.

## <a name="3.3"></a>3.3. Username and profile picture

Your username and profile picture may not contain any inappropriate content.

## <a name="3.4"></a>3.4. Play to the best of your ability

Always play your matches as competitively as possible. Even if your promotion or demotion status is guaranteed, the games likely have an effect on the statuses of the other players in your division or on their tiebreakers. Noncompetitive behavior is unfair to your opponents and may result in a suspension per [7.2](#7.2).

<a name="3.4.1"></a>3.4.1. If you have played a game to the best of your ability and you believe you have no chance of winning the game, you may resign it.

<a name="3.4.2"></a>3.4.2. You may never forfeit a game when it is too early or too unclear to assess a winner. In addition to a warning or suspension as appropriate, a moderator will ask you to play out any games that were forfeited.

<a name="3.4.3"></a>3.4.3. You may not collude with other players or otherwise compromise the competitive integrity of your matches.

## <a name="3.5"></a>3.5. Misconduct

If you witness or experience any misconduct, including but not limited to the examples listed in [3.1](#3.1), please alert a moderator immediately and share any screenshot evidence you have. Depending on the severity of the misconduct, the offending player may be warned or suspended per [7.2](#7.2).

# <a name="4"></a>4. Match Structure

## <a name="4.1"></a>4.1. Matches

A match is 6 games between the same two players, with each player going first 3 times. Each player plays one match against each other player in their division.

<a name="4.1.1"></a>4.1.1. Matches must be played on [Dominion Online](https://dominion.games/).

<a name="4.4.3"></a>4.4.3. Familiar cards should not be respected.

<a name="4.4.4"></a>4.4.4. For games using expansions, the disliked cards lists and banned cards lists should be respected, and the liked cards lists should not be.

## <a name="4.5"></a>4.5. Changes to the defaults

The default table settings in [4.4](#4.4) may be changed between games by mutual agreement of you and your opponent except:

<a name="4.5.1"></a>4.5.1. You may not agree to disallow spectators ([4.4.1](#4.4.1)).

<a name="4.5.2"></a>4.5.2. If your game does not use expansions, you may not use Familiar cards or any cardlists ([4.4.3](#4.4.3) & [4.4.5](#4.4.5)).

Players may have different opinions on which undos should be allowed, if any.

<a name="4.6.1"></a>4.6.1. The default policy is that you at least grant all undos that are for small numbers of steps and that did not reveal new game information.

<a name="4.6.2"></a>4.6.2. You may choose a different policy regarding which undos you will allow, so long as you announce it to your opponent before the game.

## <a name="4.7"></a>4.7. Abandoning games

In the rare event of a game which must be abandoned, players should play a new game in its place. Abandoned games do not count toward match completion or match score.

<a name="4.7.1"></a>4.7.1. If a player has connection issues or otherwise cannot continue a game, they should reload the same game another time. If the game can’t be reloaded (e.g. due to an internal error or impassable bug), the players should abandon the game.

<a name="4.7.2"></a>4.7.2. If players mutually agree their current game is a stalemate, they may abandon the game. If the players don’t agree about a stalemate, then they must play on.

Each game you win is reported as 1 win. Each game you tie is reported as 0.5 wins.

<a name="4.8.1"></a>4.8.1. Per Dominion rules, a game with tied VP scores is won by the player who took fewer turns (not counting extra turns).

## <a name="4.9"></a>4.9. Submitting results

After each playing session, you or your opponent should submit the results of that playing session as soon as possible using the Results form linked in your division’s Discord channel.

<a name="4.9.3"></a>4.9.3. Only submit results for games that actually happened. Reporting fraudulent results or forfeited games per [3.4.2](#3.4.2) may result in a suspension per [7.2](#7.2).

## <a name="4.10"></a>4.10. Playing under protest

In the case of a disputed rules infraction, you should reach out to a moderator for help. If a moderator decision needs to be made that affects the outcome of a game, you should finish the game, and you may protest the game by contacting your moderator with a description of what occurred and the game number. The moderator team will review the game and make a ruling by a majority vote whether the game results stand or that the game must be replayed.

## <a name="4.11"></a>4.11. Extra/non-standard matches

There are several types of matches ([adjustment](#5.5), [play-in](#5.4), and [tiebreaker](#5.2)) that take place outside of the normal league season, and differ from standard league matches in various ways. In all respects but those listed below, they follow the standard league match format.

<a name="4.11.1"></a>4.11.1. Adjustment and tiebreaker matches are 2-game matches with each player starting one of the games.

<a name="4.11.2"></a>4.11.2. Play-in matches are standard 6-game matches, but if one player reaches 3.5 or more wins, they win the match, and there is no need to complete any remaining games.

<a name="4.11.3"></a>4.11.3. If the players are tied after completing all games per [4.11.1](#4.11.1) or [4.11.2](#4.11.2), they play one final game with a random player starting.

<a name="4.11.4"></a>4.11.4. If there is still a tie, the player that went second in the last game wins.

<a name="4.11.5"></a>4.11.5. A player who does not wish to play one of these matches may concede.

<a name="4.11.6"></a>4.11.6. If one player fails to respond promptly or is unable to play, that player concedes by default.

<a name="4.11.7"></a>4.11.7. If neither player responds promptly or both respond but cannot arrange the match in the required time, the moderators will randomly choose a winner.
