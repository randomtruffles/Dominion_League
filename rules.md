# <a name="1"></a>1. Registration

## <a name="1.1"></a>1.1. Membership requirements

To join the Dominion League, you must meet all these requirements:

<a name="1.1.1"></a>1.1.1. You have a [Dominion Online](https://dominion.games/) account with 10 or more rated 2-player games. You do not need to purchase a subscription to Dominion Online.

<a name="1.1.2"></a>1.1.2. You are a member of the [Dominion (by Donald X Vaccarino)](https://discord.gg/vMmmMBu) Discord server.

<a name="1.1.3"></a>1.1.3. You are not already playing in the Dominion League with any other Dominion Online or Discord accounts.

<a name="1.1.4"></a>1.1.4. You have basic English language proficiency, so you can communicate with the moderators and your opponents.

<a name="1.1.5"></a>1.1.5. Your username and profile picture comply with the conduct rules in [3.3](#3.3).

## <a name="1.2"></a>1.2. Signing up

If you meet all the requirements and are not playing in the current season, you may fill out the [sign-up form](http://dominionleague.org/sign-ups) for the upcoming season. A moderator will review your submission and contact you via Discord. Until they do, your participation is not confirmed.

<a name="1.2.1"></a>1.2.1. After the sign-up deadline passes, you may still sign up for the waiting list. If spots open up during the early weeks of a season, moderators may fill them with players from the waiting list, depending on skill and time zone. Players who have dropped from the current season may not re-enter via the wait list.

## <a name="1.3"></a>1.3. Returning

If you are playing in the current season and would like to join the next season, fill out the Returning Form linked in your division’s Discord channel. Otherwise, you will by default leave the League after the current season.

## <a name="1.4"></a>1.4. Hiatus

You retain your tier placement, space permitting (see [2.4](#2.4) and [2.5](#2.5)), during a break of up to 5 consecutive seasons. If you rejoin after a break of 6 or more consecutive seasons, you will be placed as a new player.

## <a name="1.5"></a>1.5. Accounts

You may switch your Dominion Online or Discord account at any time by letting your moderator know, but you may not join the League additional times using other accounts.

## <a name="2"></a>2. League Structure

## <a name="2.1"></a>2.1. Pacing

Each season lasts 6 weeks, and most are followed by a 2-week break. Once per year there is a longer 6-week break for the Shuffle iT Championship tournament in September.

## <a name="2.2"></a>2.2 Divisions

A division is a group of approximately 6 players who will play each other during a season. Each division is assigned a moderator from the [League moderator team](https://dominionleague.org/moderators). The number of divisions depends on the number of players.

## <a name="2.2"></a>2.3. Tiers

The divisions are grouped into tiers. The number of tiers depends on the number of divisions. There is a single division in tier A. Starting with tier B, the following rules dictate the size of a tier:

<a name="2.3.1"></a>2.3.1. The maximum number of divisions in a tier is twice the maximum of the tier above it, except every third tier which has the same maximum number as the one above it.

<a name="2.3.2"></a>2.3.2 Tiers A through D always have the maximum number of divisions. The moderators at their discretion may choose to have fewer than the maximum number of divisions in tiers E and below.

<a name="2.3.3"></a>2.3.3. The lowest two tiers have approximately the same number of divisions.

<a name="2.3.4"></a>2.3.4. The moderators may make exceptions to these tier count rules to account for probable changes in the size of the League.

## <a name="2.4"></a>2.4. Tier Placement

Players are placed into tiers using the following criteria, in order:

<a name="2.4.1"></a>2.4.1. Players who played in the previous season are placed into their tier from that season, unless they earned a promotion or demotion ([5.3](#5.3)), in which case they are placed according to the promotion and demotion rules.

<a name="2.4.2"></a>2.4.2. Players returning to the League after completing one of the past 6 seasons are placed into the tier they would have most recently returned to, starting with the players that played most recently, and with ties broken by seeding ([2.6](#2.6)).

<a name="2.4.3"></a>2.4.3. Players returning to the League who did not complete one of the past 6 seasons, and players joining the League for the first time, are placed into tiers based on their Dominion Online level. Levels will be collected at a time specified on the [sign-up page](http://dominionleague.org/sign-ups).

<a name="2.4.4"></a>2.4.4. If there are still open spots in a tier, players in the tier below may receive free promotions to fill them. See [5.4](#5.4) for details.

## <a name="2.5"></a>2.5. Flex Divisions

Divisions usually have a maximum of 6 players. However, divisions may “flex” up to a size of 7 players in order to accommodate returning players ([2.4.2](#2.4.2)) or particularly highly-rated players ([2.4.3](#2.4.3)). Free promotions ([5.4](#5.4)) are only used to fill divisions up to the normal maximum of 6 players.

## <a name="2.6"></a>2.6. Seeding

Each tier of players is split into divisions by a seeding algorithm. The algorithm takes into account time zones in tiers E and below, previous performance in the League for returning players, and Dominion Online level for new players.
